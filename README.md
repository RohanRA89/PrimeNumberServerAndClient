Program allows for Server/Client interaction.

Client takes in number value and server does the calculations to determine if the number is prime or not.
Server sends a response back to the client. Images attached show the error mentioned in the Socket Creation

**Note error pictured only happens when running the program as a .jar file through the command prompt.
This error is not an issue when being run through the IDE.
